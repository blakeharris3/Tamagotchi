## General Feedback
Blake, you did amazing on your Tamagotchi project! You took advantage of an excellent use case of a JavaScript class to construct tamagotchi objects! Iâ€™ve placed additional comments inside of you files for you to review, so be sure to have a look at them. Also be sure to review the Glows, Grows, and Code Quality sections below for more feedback.

## Glows

For your Tamagotchi project, a few things you did extremely well was using a javaScript class to create Tamagotchi objects. You also applied plenty of custom styles and animations using css and velocity js. You also did an excellent job adding evolution functionality to your Tamagotchi as well. Great job Blake

## Grows

You did amazing for week three Blake, you quickly caught on with JavaScript classes and DOM manipulation. A couple small things I would suggest following this assignment would be to make sure you html title tag always has text in it to tell your browser the name of your site. Also, try to take advantage of when you can source your images locally rather than via http / online.

## Code Quality

Your code quality is really coming along. In this project I saw many instances of good indentation and appropriate naming of variables and functions. One small thing I would mention for this area as a suggestion would be to make sure to remove all commented out / non-functional code from the files contained in your master branch. Other than that keep up the good work Blake!
